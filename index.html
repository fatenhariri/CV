          effective field theory using the Monte Carlo event generator
          MadGraph5_aMC@NLO:
          <ul>
            <li> Implemented MET systematics tool (future oriented), improved the analysis results
              and published them in the collaboration notes. This definition was used by default
              later in 2016 analyses.</li>
            <li> Built successful analysis codes, evaluated the trickiest background model in Higgs
              → ττ analysis and showed potential improvement in the extracted signal with track
              MET (published results).</li>
            <li>Optimized Higgs → WW analysis, outperforming (> 50%) the standard analysis of the
              collaboration</li>
            <li>
              Applied an innovative method not adopted by the collaboration to find new physics (see

Implemented and optimized a production/decay merging tool and corrected the
treatment of particles.

Rectified some model parameters to allow correct event generation and automated a

            <li>
Tested and validated a new model to be used by future analyses (used during 2016).

          My work led to a paper update and a software update added to MG5_aMC_v2_2_1
release.
